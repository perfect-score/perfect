about.heading=About the Perfect Score
about.concept_head=The Concept
about.concept_1=The Perfect Score is a website that attempts to predict English Premier League results based on algorithms and data. Furthermore, it attempts to predict the exact score for each game - which is a very difficult task.

about.motivation_head=The Motivation
about.motivation_1=The driving force behind the concept is to predict results of un-played games as accurately as possible. If this is achieved, then ultimately final league positions will be able to be calculated ahead of time.

about.problem_head=The Problem
about.problem_1=Predicting football results is hard - really hard. Football is a "random" sport - meaning that anything can happen, any team can win, any player can score - all within certain physical possibilities and boundaries.
about.problem_2=The number of event variables is huge - so predicting the correct result, let alone the correct score, is a tough ask. And whilst the perfect score is unlikely, it is a firm desire to be able to achieve a prediction that is as accurate as possible.

about.finally_head=And Finally...
about.finally_1=Enjoy the predictions, and please remember they are a little bit of fun.
